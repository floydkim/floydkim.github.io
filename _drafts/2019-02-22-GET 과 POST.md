# HTTP GET

GET 메서드는 특정한 자원으로부터 데이터를 요청할 때 사용합니다.
GET은 HTTP 메서드 중 가장 일반적인 것 중 하나입니다.

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:
```
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
```
Some other notes on GET requests:

GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests is only used to request data (not modify)


# HTTP POST

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:
```
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
```
POST is one of the most common HTTP methods.

Some other notes on POST requests:

POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length
